# CPI-Trends-and-Macroeconomic-Insights
📊 Overview : 
This project explores how major global economic factors—particularly crude oil price fluctuations—have influenced India’s inflation trends between 2020 and 2023.
The analysis examines category-wise CPI (Consumer Price Index) data, focusing on food, health, and essential services inflation across rural and urban segments.
Through Excel-based correlation, visualization, and storytelling, the project decodes the post-pandemic inflation behavior of the Indian economy.

🎯 Objectives: 
Investigate inflation patterns across key categories — Food, Health, and Essential Services.
Analyze the relationship between imported crude oil price fluctuations and category-wise inflation.
Compare urban vs rural inflation behavior and identify areas of divergence.
Highlight post-COVID disinflation trends and structural drivers of persistent inflation.

🧩 Dataset: 
Source: CPI Data (2013–2023), Government of India
Assumption: “Light and Fuel” category used as a proxy for imported crude oil price trends
Data Format: Monthly CPI index values for urban, rural, and combined segments

🧮 Methodology : 
Data Cleaning & Transformation: Structured CPI indices for monthly analysis
Month-on-Month (MoM) Inflation: Calculated to track short-term price movement
Year-on-Year (YoY) Inflation: Captured long-term inflationary trends
Correlation Analysis:
Used Excel =CORREL() function to measure strength of relationship between crude oil (Light & Fuel index) and other CPI categories
Visualization: Created line and combo charts in Excel to interpret category-wise trends

📈 Key Insights : 
Food Inflation declined sharply post-2021, reflecting easing supply-chain pressures.
Health Inflation stayed elevated even after the pandemic, showing structural cost persistence.
Essential Services Inflation moderated due to fiscal interventions and fuel price normalization.
High correlation observed between “Oils & Fats” and crude oil prices, confirming direct cost transmission.
Egg and perishables showed weak or negative correlation — supply-driven rather than energy-linked.
General Inflation remained stable (~6%) despite global volatility, suggesting resilient domestic demand.

💡 Key Takeaways : 
Post-COVID, India entered a phase of gradual disinflation led by food and services categories.
Crude oil prices have a cascading impact on multiple CPI components, especially food processing and transportation.
Urban inflation dominated in healthcare and services, while rural areas faced higher food inflation.
The correlation framework demonstrates how global shocks translate into household-level price effects.

🧰 Tools & Techniques : 
Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning, analysis, visualization
Statistical Functions: =CORREL, =AVERAGE, =STDEV, =PERCENTCHANGE
Charts Used: Line Graphs, Combo Charts, Correlation Tables

📚 Conclusion : 
This project highlights the interconnectedness of global crude oil prices and India’s inflation behavior.
While policy interventions helped contain headline inflation, the structural cost pressures in energy and health sectors continue to influence the overall CPI trend.
The findings underscore the importance of energy price stability in maintaining long-term price control and sustainable growth.
